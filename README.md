# OnTheMap

The On The Map app allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs, allowing students to place themselves “on the map,” so to speak. 
First, the user logs in to the app using their Udacity username and password or by Facebook. 

After login, the app downloads locations and links previously posted by other students. These links can point to any URL that a student chooses. A user can post their own location and link. The locations are specified with text and forward geocoded. They can be as specific as a full street address or as generic as “Costa Rica” or “Seattle, WA.”
